Welcome to EigenSDK-RS, the Rust port of Layr-labs' EigenSDK-GO. This SDK is a high-performance, reliable, and efficient library designed to interact with the Eigen Network. It integrates seamlessly with Eigen's ecosystem while leveraging the many advantages of Rust.

As this SDK is currently under active development, instability should be expected.
